"""Seed the Companies watchlist tab with a curated set of tech companies.

Resolves every candidate locally (ATS detection + board verification) so the
production pipeline never has to probe a large batch, then appends only the
companies whose boards actually answer. Re-running skips names already present.

Usage:
    python scripts/seed_companies.py          # dry run: resolve + report only
    python scripts/seed_companies.py --apply  # resolve + append to the Sheet

The list is curated for: public ATS APIs we can poll (Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby,
Workday, SmartRecruiters, Workable, Recruitee), companies known to sponsor
work visas, and active early-career engineering hiring. Mega-caps with custom
anti-bot portals (Google, Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft...) are
deliberately absent — aggregator sources cover them.
